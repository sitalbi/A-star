# A-star
A-star pathfinding algorithm implementation in Unity (using version 2019.3.5). Working for 2D projects only.

This algorithm is optimized using a minimum binary heap data structure. The starting point of the path is the point of coordinate (0,0).

## Example:

- Launch the Unity project

- Create a map with the sample tileset provided (or use your own)

- Once you created the map, all you need is to click on a location
  
- The path is then calculated and printed on the screen (in red)
